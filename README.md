##Introduction 

We use computers everyday. Yet, not many of us can claim they understand, even on a very high level, how exactly computers operate. Yes we all understand there is a RAM, a CPU and everything is represented as 1's and 0's, but do we really understand what happens from the second you press the "On button" and the moment when your operating system comes one the screen? Well let's dive in!

##Overview of Computer Architecture

Computers are really not that complicated. Here is the big idea: a **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) reads bits of data from **memory**, performs calcuations or logical operations, and writes the resulting data back into memory. That's literally it. There are sometimes other devices called **peripheral devices** that provide input and output and secondary mass storage. 

To give you an idea of how fast processors are, Intel's "ancient" Pentium microprocessor can run at over 300 **MIPS** (million instructions per second).
